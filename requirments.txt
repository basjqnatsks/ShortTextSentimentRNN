# Note: It's highly recommended to use specific versions for reproducibility.
# After installing these packages in your environment (e.g., using pip install pandas numpy ...),
# you can generate a file with exact versions by running:
# pip freeze > requirements.txt
# This will replace this file with one containing lines like: pandas==2.1.4 numpy==1.26.2 etc.
